## Introduction

Scriba is a highly adaptable, AI-powered code completion plugin for web-based code editors. Open-source and dx-friendly, Scriba is designed to effortlessly integrate AI code completion (ghost suggestions) into web-based text/code editors. 

## Why 

Many SaaS startups/web applications include web-based code editors as one of their core features and with the rise of AI-powered tools for the IDE, like GitHub Copilot, the demand for code completion in web-based code editors has exponentially increased. Scriba exists to fill this need, making the code completion feature available to any web application using Codemirror or Monaco, quick and easy.
